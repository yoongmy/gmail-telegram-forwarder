A Python script that automatically checks a Gmail account for new, unread emails matching a specific subject filter and forwards a summary of them to a Telegram chat.This is ideal for receiving real-time notifications for important emails, such as alerts, confirmations, or messages from a specific service.FeaturesGmail Integration: Securely authenticates with your Gmail account using the official Google API.Subject Filtering: Monitors only for emails that contain a specific keyword in their subject line.Real-time Forwarding: Runs in a continuous loop to check for new emails at a configurable interval.Telegram Notifications: Sends neatly formatted messages to a specified Telegram chat, including the sender, subject, date, and a preview of the email body.Prevents Duplicates: Automatically marks emails as 'read' after forwarding to ensure they are not sent again.Robust Logging: Keeps a log of its activities and any errors for easy troubleshooting.PrerequisitesBefore you begin, ensure you have the following:Python 3.6+ installed on your system.A Google Account (e.g., Gmail).A Telegram Account.Setup InstructionsFollow these steps to configure and run the forwarder.1. Clone the Repository & Install DependenciesFirst, get the code and install the required Python libraries.# Clone this repository (if applicable)
# git clone [https://your-repo-url.git](https://your-repo-url.git)

A new tab or window will open in your web browser.Log in to the Google account you want to monitor.Grant the script permission to view your emails.After authorization, a token.json file will be created in the same directory. This file stores your credentials so you won't have to log in again.Normal OperationAfter the first run, the script will start immediately and run in a loop, checking for emails every 60 seconds (or whatever CHECK_INTERVAL is set to). It will also send a startup message to your Telegram chat.To run it continuously in the background, you can use a tool like nohup:nohup python3 your_script_name.py &
LoggingThe script logs its status and any errors to the console and to a file located at /var/log/gmail_telegram_forwarder.log. If you encounter issues, check this file for details.
